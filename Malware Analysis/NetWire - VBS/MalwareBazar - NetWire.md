### VirusTotal:
- Shows 4 detections as a trojan (Downloader.Powershell.Agent)

## Initial Look:
- Converting some long HEX strings in CyberChef gives the following interesting strings:
```
C:\Users\ \AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\
new:13709620-C279-11CE-A49E-444553540000
https://kinmirai.org/wp-content/plugins/akismet/views/iubig2.txt
```
- Maybe trying to download something from the link and creating persistence using the Start up folder
- Also using COM object to run commands

## Behaviour:
- Nothing interesting happening
- On a closer look, the same script gets moved to the start up folder to create persistence
